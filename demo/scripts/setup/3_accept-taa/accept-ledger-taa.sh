If Transaction Author does not agree to this\nAgreement in its entirety, do not click \"Accept\" or write Transactions to the\nSovrin Ledger Networks.\n\n\nIf Sovrin Foundation makes material changes to this Agreement, Sovrin Foundation will notify you\nby posting a notice on Sovrin Foundation’s website prior to the effective date of the changes. \nBy continuing to act as a Transaction Author or by otherwise writing Transactions on the\nSovrin Ledger Networks after Sovrin Foundation posts changes to their website, you agree to be\nbound by the revised Agreement.\n\n\nWHEREAS, Transaction Author desires to write Transactions to the Sovrin\nLedger Networks (each a \"**Transaction**\"); and\n\n\nWHEREAS, subject to Transaction Author complying with the terms and\nconditions of this Agreement, Sovrin Foundation grants permission to \nTransaction Author to write Transactions to the Sovrin Ledger Networks;\n\n\nFOR GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION, THE SUFFICIENCY OF WHICH IS HEREBY\nACKNOWLEDGED, THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\n\n\n## 1) Definitions\n\n\na. \"**Data Protection Laws**\" means the GDPR and any other data protection and\nprivacy laws, regulations, and regulatory requirements applicable to a party\nunder this Agreement.\n\n\nb. \"**GDPR**\" means the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679\non the protection of natural persons with regard to the Processing of personal\ndata and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC,\nand any amendment or replacement to it.\n\n\nc. \"**Impermissible Personal Data**\" means the Personal Data that\nTransaction Author writes to the Sovrin Ledger Networks that is not\nPermissible Personal Data.\n\n\nd. \"**Personal Data Transactions**\" has the meaning set forth in Section 3\nbelow.\n\n\ne. \"**Permissible Personal Data**\" means Personal Data that Transaction\nAuthor writes to the Sovrin Ledger Networks that is permitted under this\nAgreement and the Sovrin Governance Framework (including the\n[Sovrin Ledger Access Policies](https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Ledger-Access-Policies-V1.pdf)).\n\n\nf. \"**Personal Data**\" means information that relates, directly or\nindirectly, to a data subject, including without limitation, names, email\naddresses, postal addresses, identification numbers, location data, online\nidentifiers or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological,\ngenetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of the data subject.\n\n\ng. \"**Process**\" or \"**Processing**\" means any operation or set of\noperations which is performed on Transactions data, whether or not by\nautomated means, such as the access, collection, use, storage, disclosure,\ndissemination, combination, recording, organization, structuring, adaption,\nalteration, copying, transfer, retrieval, consultation, disposal, restriction,\nerasure and/or destruction of Transactions data.\n\n\nh. \"**Sovrin Governance Framework**\" means Sovrin Foundation’s\ngovernance policies and rules available at\nhttps://sovrin.org/governance-framework/ or any successor website.\n\n\nUnless otherwise defined above, all capitalized terms used in this Agreement\nshall have the meanings given to them in this Agreement or in the Sovrin\nGovernance Framework and corresponding Sovrin Glossary.

Sovrin Foundation hereby grants to Transaction Author a non-exclusive,\nnon-assignable, non-sublicensable, royalty free, revocable license to write to\nand use the Sovrin Ledger Networks in accordance with this Agreement and the\nSovrin Governance Framework.\n\n\nb. When authoring Transactions under the policy of Permissioned Write Access,\na Transaction Author may only write to the Sovrin Ledger Networks by using an\nauthorized Transaction Endorser. In the event that Sovrin Foundation enables\nPublic Write Access to the Sovrin Ledger Networks, Transaction Author will\nnot need a Transaction Endorser to endorse a Transaction.\n\n\nc. Once an initial Transaction has been written to one of the Sovrin Ledger\nNetworks by Transaction Author (\"**Initial Transaction**\"), the\nTransaction Author is granted permission to make additional Transactions to\nupdate the state of a previous Transaction (\"**Update Transactions**\"). Please\nnote, an Update Transaction does not remove the Initial Transaction, which\nwill remain on the Sovrin Ledger due to its immutability and may remain on\nSovrin Test Networks unless they are reset. Transaction Author may make Update\nTransactions if and only if Transaction Author was the author of the\nInitial Transaction. Update Transactions are Transactions and are subject to\nall the terms of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n## 3) Transaction Author Obligations\n\n\na. With regard to all Transactions, Transaction Author will:\n\n\n  1. comply with any requirements imposed by the Transaction Endorser on the\n  Transaction Author and any Transactions endorsed by the Transaction\n  Endorser;\n\n\n  2. not write Transactions containing Personal Data until Sovrin Foundation\n  approves Public Write Access and permits Transactions to contain Personal\n  Data pursuant to Section 3(b) below.\n\n\nb. If Sovrin Foundation approves Public Write Access and permits\nTransaction Authors to write Transactions that contain Permissible Personal\nData (\"**Personal Data Transactions**\"), then Transaction Author expressly\nagrees that:\n\n\n  1. It will not write any Transactions that contain Impermissible Personal\n  Data to the Sovrin Ledger Networks;\n\n\n  2. it is an independent data controller (as defined in the GDPR) of the\n  Personal Data Transactions and will be responsible for the lawfulness of the\n  Processing of such data in compliance with the Data Protection Laws;\n\n\n  3. it acknowledges and will notify all data subjects whose Personal Data it\n  Processes that functions inherent in blockchain technology may render\n  fulfilling data subject requests difficult or impossible. For example, due\n  to blockchain’s immutability, data stored on a blockchain generally cannot\n  be removed or altered once the data is confirmed on the blockchain;\n\n\n  4. it irrevocably waives any and all claims, rights and/or obligations it\n  may have now or in the future against Sovrin Foundation as a result of\n  being unable to fulfill data subject requests in accordance with Data\n  Protection Laws;\n\n\n  5. it agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions applicable to\n  Transaction Author as a controller of Personal Data Transactions under the\n  Data Processing Agreements with Stewards and Transaction Endorsers, each in\n  their roles as processors under the GDPR, and attached as Appendices A and B\n  (the \"**DPAs**\");\n\n\n  6. that Sovrin Foundation has the right to enter into the DPAs on its\n  behalf and the DPAs are made a part of the Agreement in their entirety;\n\n\n  7. by signing this Agreement, each Party is deemed to have signed the DPAs,\n  including the Standard Contractual Clauses with Sovrin Foundation and\n  Transaction Author as the \"Data exporter\", and with either a Steward or a\n  Transaction Endorser as \"Data importer\", as applicable;\n\n\n  8. at Sovrin Foundation’s request, Transaction Author will reimburse\n  Sovrin Foundation for any costs incurred by Sovrin Foundation in\n  enforcing Transaction Author’s rights under the GDPR, including but not\n  limited to fulfillment of data subject rights, rights of oversight and\n  audit, etc.; and\n\n\n  9. it irrevocably waives any and all claims that it may have now or in the\n  future that Sovrin Foundation lacks the rights to enter into the DPAs on\n  its behalf and bind Transaction Author to the DPAs’ terms and conditions,\n  including the limitation of liability therein.\n\n\n\n\n## 4) Term and Termination\n\n\na. This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and shall remain in force\nuntil terminated by either Party pursuant to this **Section 4 (Term and\nTermination)**.\n\n\nb. Either Party may terminate this Agreement: (i) if the other Party has\nmaterially defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations under this\nAgreement and has not cured such default within fifteen (15) business days of\nreceipt of written notice from the non-defaulting Party of such default or\n(ii) immediately in the event of any government sanctions or other legal\nmeasures that make it unlawful for Transaction Author to write Transactions to\nthe Sovrin Ledger Networks.\n\n\nc. Additionally, Transaction Author may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days'\''\nadvance written notice to Sovrin Foundation and ceasing all use of the\nSovrin Ledger Networks.\n\n\nd.
